An Open Source Localization Initiative
--------------------------------------

PepoLoc is an open-source localization initiative founded by HorseLord-Abrek (Abrek Ko√ß). The localization industry has always been a locked box compared to many other IT fields. It lacks open-source and community support. Many of the freeware or open-source projects are from B.C. (I mean, they function but the interface has the win98 vibe). Even the paid programs lack an appealing interface and they have limited customization/hard-to-understand SDKs. With this initiative, I at least aim to build a community that mostly talks about and builds for Localization Engineering topics but all the other topics related to Localization are welcome as well. This is the first version of the PepoLoc introductory readme and it is subject (and open) to changes. Your contributions are highly appreciated!
